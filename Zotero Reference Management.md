![[zotero_logo.png]]

---
### Preamble
This is mostly a 'follow-along' or an interactive demonstration of using Zotero as a reference management software. Please feel free to ask questions during the demonstration so we can proceed together. I will try to answer to the best of my experience and knowledge.

# Introduction 🔬
- Researchers need efficient and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reliable</mark> reference management software to organize sources and generate citations.
- The software should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">easy</mark> to use, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">compatible</mark> with various formats and platforms, and ideally <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">free</mark> or low-cost to accommodate tight budgets. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Zotero offers a comprehensive suite of features to meet these needs.</mark>

# Compare ⚖️
Other reference management tools like EndNote, Mendeley, and RefWorks also offer robust features but often come with limitations:

- 💰Cost: EndNote and RefWorks full featured require expensive subscription.
- 💁‍♂️Limited Integration: EndNote don't have web browser integration. Many don't support LibreOffice and Google Docs.
- 💬User Community, Support, and Customisation: Zotero’s open-source nature fosters a large, active user community that contributes to frequent updates and extensive support resources as well as variety of plugins to enhance Zotero functionalities.

### About Me 🙇

> [!cite]Hi! 👋 I'm Alvin Alexander. I love coding in Python🐍 and working with machine learning so much that I ended up doing a PhD in computer science on applying GANs to satellite images. I have been using Zotero for the past two years for class assignments, personal curiosity, and research.
